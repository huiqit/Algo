/*
Determine the number of bits that are different for two given integers.
Examples: 5(“0101”) and 8(“1000”) has 3 different bits

/*
^: 相同为0，不同为1。-> 有多少1，就有多少位不同

public int diffBits(int a, int b) {
	int c = a^b;
	int count = 0;
	for(int c; c != 0; c = c >> 1) {
		count += c & 1;
	}
	return count;
}
error 1: int c redefine. only can write: int c = a^b
error 2: assume a and b are positive. it doesn't work for negative, since c>>1 will add 1 for negative number, and forever diff
-> c = c>>>1
